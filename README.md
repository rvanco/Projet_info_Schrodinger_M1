[Schrodinger.py] has been created to give the best answer we could think of to the problem ["The Schrödinger" problem].
""" 
To run our solution some package are required, you can find them in the requirement.txt file.

The structure of our work is the following : 

  The file "Schrodinger.py" regroups all the functions we are using to obtain results. 
  This file includes the numerical method (Numerov).
  
  The file "exemples.ipynb" regroups all the different potentials we used and some results we got.
  
  
  
  
  
  
all  the best,
