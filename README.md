This repository has been created to give the best answer we could think of to the numerical resolution of the 1D Schrödinger equation.

To run our solution some package are required, you can find them in the requirement.txt file.

The structure of our work is the following : 

  The file "Schrodinger.py" regroups all the functions we are using to obtain results. 
  This file includes the numerical method (Numerov).
  
  The file "exemples.ipynb" regroups different exemples of the use of the functions defined in Schrodinger.py, mainly the code we used in order to generate the results presented in the report. Those exemples are explained and commented.
  
  The file "Schrodinger_alternative.ipynb" is another way to answer the problem with the functions and the results on the same file.
  
  
  
  
all  the best,

Bakri Benjamin, Hartweg Tom, Maurer Florian, Bidzinski Nora, Nolot Toni, Joussot Maël, Vancoellié Renaud
